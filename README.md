# The main goal of the study

- Security breaches that drone swarms may create in the air defense system must be determined in advance.
- In this study, an intelligent drone detection system is proposed for the detection of drone swarm.
- Among the object detection methods, the YOLO algorithm was preferred as the optimum method.
